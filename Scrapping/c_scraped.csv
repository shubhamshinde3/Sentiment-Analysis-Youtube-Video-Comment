The bits & pieces of Ashneer we see on Shark Tank form an oversimplified depiction of the Ashneer we see in this longer interview. He is so incisive with his commentary. His perspective on business-related matters is always golden. You might not agree with everything he says but you have to respect the man for embracing a unique viewpoint that often differs from conventional wisdom.

77,"""If you don't like a person that much, get to know them better.""

Ashneer's image changed just listening to him. People were judging him just based on leaked audio. 

We all talk like that when we get angry. If we say we will hurt someone, we don't actually mean it. No one can say ""How can he say like that"" because we all behave like that. He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. 

People are just waiting to point fingers at someone when he is doing something wrong, esp if he is famous. Go to the street behind your house, everyone talks like that and no one cares."
78,Ashneer is like the best mentor one can ever get
79,"Great Conversation & best line as an investor - ""You can be problem solver but can't be problem""."

144,"Many of us still live with the conservative mindsets and fail to accept the crystal clear facts and reciprocate to the feedback positively, especially when its very straight forward. Infact, we often expect a sugar coated statements with hollow compliments from our audiances or the people around us..

Ashneer Grower makes it very simple, crisp and clear. His ideology as a businessman (not so called fancy jargons - an entrepreneur, widely used from a decade or so) is outstanding. ""Bhai, agar aap dukaan kholke baithe ho to din ke ant me grahak aur dhandha dono aane chahiye, paise banne chahiye, baki to sab gyan hai. Meri acchi baate sunke aapka aur mera pet nahi bharega.""

351,Best podcast ever heard. Very straightforward and on point .
352,"Without Ashneer sir, Shark tank makes no sense"

356,1:15:46 the person behind set also laughed 
357,I like ashneer he is simplified 
358,Not even a single negative comment. Indians really understand who have content inside. Proud of all viewers. Best one was NO ADVICE for Entrepreneurs while Raj asked for general Advice. Tip:Don't Ask general question and expect direct answer.
359,"Excellent episode. Ashneer Grover is super smart, intelligent and amazing entrepreneur. Thanks for getting him on the show, soo much to learn from him. People unnecessarily hate on him soo much.

Hindi is our business language
And remaining about english that is skill only that i should learn for conversation with abroad people."
371,This was one of the best podcasts to hear! So much to learn and understand.
372,"The only issue with today's fintechs is, they consider regulators as a BIG hindrance to their growth story. For them, there shouldn't be anything called compliance. 

They laugh at the growth stories of the age old financial institutions because they took time to glory. 

THIS ATTITUDE OF FINTECHS WILL MAKE THEM EXTINCT AFTER 5 years of being in the market. Because the investors are nobody's relative except for the Profits. 

So let's see where will these 12% & Postpe's of the World be standing after 5 years from now."
373,"57:57
I got to know why Ashneer use the word ""Dhanda"" instead of business.
Hindi gives him more clarity so that he can express opinions in honest way."
374,His point of saying no is so true. I need to learn it more .
375,Very RAW ... really helped a lot FIGURING OUT a lot of things !

379,"To all those persons who were judgemental for ashneer character, its time to think straight forward in your life."
380,Good PR strategy after being found of irregularities in financial transactions at Bharat Pe. Not to mention the rude behaviour he had towards a Kotak employees.
381,only podcast which i completed in 1 sitting without losing concentration.
382,"From here 1:09:56, I love his helping nature !!! Bcoz I m that guy who pass sometimes judgement ki bhai tu yahan kese fas gaya !!! I want to be like Ashneer helping nature without asking why u r in that shit !!!"
383,"some people get stuck in consuming information and never take action, but he changed my mind that he never listened to any podcast or have not read any motivational or self help  book...... woohooo"
384,"You should have asked about Kotak issue,ik its hard for him there,but as even this was his choice,did he say you to not ask?"
385,He's one of the most interesting entrepreneur in India.
386,1:01:50 I think Ashneer felt that feeling everytime Raj started speaking Business Language
387,Thank you for this conversation.
388,Most apt statement “Indian customers are most spoilt customers in the world”

403,41:33  very important fundamentals for entrepreneurship
404,He is real and practical guy
405,"Asneer has taught more then 2 year full time MBA +3 years job experience in a single 1 hour talk .......
Only thing is he need to channellise his anger from words towards more involvement into business, if he can do that, he can beat elon musk and Jeff bezos together. 
He need to keep calm and become more classy or funny when he is angry. 
This view is based on current scenario in Feb 22."
406,Amazing interview.....
407,"amazing conversation, like we see the as usual side of the ASHNEER sir (A STRAIGHT FORWARD MAN) , its totally absolutely mind full conversation i have heard first time ,about business problem solving, investors related talk, how you could be a best person in a brutual honesty , ticket size , market cap, role of investor in a company, what are the market problems, how your product will be differ from others..the main part is balancing of NO-YES , meine aaaj tak eesa explanation nahi dekha hoga NO OR YES ka, what the founders have to do ?  .. its a man with full of conviction. and the last the if ashneer sir making more unicorns like the bharatpe then they will definitely changed the market of india.. thanks to raj sir & ashneer sir for making this..."

556,ADMI ACCHA HAI SIRF PROBLEM HAI KI  SACCH BOLTA HAI......
557,One of the best session.loved it!!
558,What a episode!
559,Most of the time the interviewer was just repeating what Ashneer said. If you look closely he is just agreeing with everything instead of having enough intelligence or research to counter the views of Ashneer which could result in a much better conversation. Could have been a much better interview if the questions were more around some facts and actual insider business actions taken by Ashneer and the consequences of it.
560,thanks for bringing it out
561,Great conversation
562,Whatching shark tank after this jus changes the entire perspective ina good wayyy

572,Ashneer Grover... Bestest...
573,"I like this guy,,...he has created jobs for lot of Indians.....I really feel bad is what happening to him in Bharat pay board....they are afraid of his celebrity status"
574,Ashneer is the hardcore businessman
575,Man one of the best personalities I have ever seen... I genuinely want to be such raw... He is now my admiration... Honesty is a must man... Others will definitely understand you with time

Sedhi baat clear hai "
581,1st video of 1hr N above I listed and watched with skipping at any point and learned & enjoyed every part of it.

Kya clarity hai.. "
590,ashneer should check the review of his app for ios
591,"If there was to be a name for the minimalistic mind, then I would call it Ashneer."
592,Tony stark of India Love this man
593,"Best conversation I have ever seen.
Ashneer grover you killed it️"
594,"Ashneer is like that doctor who asks people to eat healthy and exercise and is hated; contrary to the person who asks all the people to eat junk, laze around and is loved."
595,The Host seems to have got money to not ask correct straight forward questions. He was just saying yes to everything.
596,He is my role model
597,Waiting for it .... Ashmeer is true to its core...   Banda gazab h
598,This guy is legitly a dhandha wala 
599,Great Interview Just loved it! though have one thing to point out here in USA UK Canada there are primarily Big grocery giants like Costco Walmart and people do stock it for a month as stores are pretty far away and they don't have privilege to get fresh stuff everyday! In India people are fortunate enough to have options for fresh produce where you can find vegetable venders probably every 10 minutes out side your home! in western world they mostly eat frozen meat and fruits veggies from cold storage and they don't have choices as they don't grow as much we do in India. their geographical conditions and extreme weather wouldn't allowed that! so Indians should be grateful about what they are getting as copying western world wouldn't be always a nice choice.
600,Would be lovely if this super shark meets the legend Rakesh jhunjhunwala..
601,Really want one podcast with Peyush Bansal !
602,"we would love to have Peeyush Bansal too, can you have him Raj bhai?"
603,50:24 this is what made him stand out as the different and more popular shark
604,53:50 Nice timing!
605,Totally changed our perspective for ashneer …..listening this podcast while driving and really enjoyed it
606,Ashneer sir is the best and an ideal for every entrepreneur
607,Aaye big ups man️
608,A very sunnict interview
609,Got to know more about him 
610,"I can totally relate to the teetoataler thing.
Sadly i always feel fomo."
611,"There is a difference between being rude and being straight forward - he is straight forward to me so i respect him. 
you might just not like the fact that he said Maar dunga and if u think this is normal so we should not hate him or you can think even if its normal, these things should not be normal so we should criticize it, I respect both the opinions. People have different opinions and we should respect all. Opinions and clear cut hatred are different right? We should respect opinions and criticism but don't throw shade for wrong reasons.
I like Ashneer sir because he is straight forward, but my favorite shark is Peyush cz he's very tech oriented like me and supports the long term vision, he really have some same values like me so he's my favorite. Vineeta is my second fav and ashneer is 3rd. I respect them all tho."
612,Simply best !
613,The only podcast I watched till the end.
614,Really Awesome Video.....
615,"Couldn't have asked any better - Mr. Vinod Khosla has this mentioned in his website - 'We prefer brutal honesty against hypocritical politeness' - Ashneer Grover sir also gave the logical analogy behind it - Highly appreciated, Take a bow "

636,"Desi guy who understand every difficult english word nuances, succinct "

639,"Raj shamani - 1 
Trs podcast - 0

I'll pray ki sab thik ho jaye jaldi se. "

Ashneer shares that it is really ironic that Bira has been his biggest portfolio investment even when he is nowhere near drinking! He elucidates why he left 9-5 work and joined an entrepreneurial venture and explains why the MRP of a product is problematic for India.
 
Ashneer shares his experience of working with different companies and startups like Kotak Investment Banking, Amex, Grofers, etc. and talks about his experience of being a part of Shark Tank India.
 
Ashneer explains how can one build a brand in India with an example of his own experience of building BharatPe. He also discusses some fundamentals that should be clear to anyone who wants to be an entrepreneur.

There is no doubt that Ashneer is an extremely smart guy.

880,"Completely agree with Raj that when you don't drink you feel left out on multiple occasions. I started my career 2 years back and I've felt this multiple times When your manager drinks , entire team drinks and they are having gala time at parties, they are only gelling up and ultimately they have that bond with higher management which comes with lot of perks. Also when your best of friends drinks and smoke and then they form their own circle of friends doing similar things wth you will do in between them  This is so wierd, almost like not drinking is crime these days specially in corporate world it is so hard to form connections if you don't drink :|"
881,It is the best podcast ever in this channel I had seen
882,Wow!!!!!!!!! Ashneer is a rock star! ️️️️
883,This is one of the best podcast.

889,"Mr. Ashneer, after hearing you now I respect you more. Sahi banda hai .. Kabhi life me mat badalna jaise ho waise hi rahena."
890,Best podcasts ever ....
891,I love how both sometimes say random words together like they be reading in sync
892,This is the best podcast of #figuringOut
893,"Truly brilliant ashneer, hatts off to u"
894,"That's the reason people like ASHNEER the MOST in Shark Tank !!!! Bcoz he is NATURAL & HONEST !!! Some people said this is scripted, but u can see yeh Banda hai hi esa thoda rude, straight forward !!! But we love him the most !!! ️️"

905,People who accepted other sharks' offers shall be regretting after listening to this genius...
906,loved the talk
907,Ashneer's spoken english is on point but still this guy gives importance to hindi. That was commendable.
908,Without MRP businessmen would have fleeced the common and poor when they know they are the only providers!
909,Do induvidual podcasts with each of the sharks please
910,Ashneer is so soothing to emerging entrepreneur ears
911,When you achieve a lot in life then you get freedom to be blunt with people.
912,"Ashneer Grover: Very Specific Person, Straight Forward. 
He is not Like an Actor, ""ki parde ke piche I'm that kind of person, & when u see in real 'inki life toh bahot hi different hai'.

917,Great conversation
918,Honest entrepreneur ever
919,"Good conversations. Should have also asked about Crypto, NFTs thoughts on publicly listed startups,thoughts on long term stock investing etc"
920,What a Guy 
921,Raj sir pls enable english subtitle. So every one can understand it clearly
922,"1. Habit forming things make a good business.
2. It is difficult to make consumer side business in India due to demanding customers.
3. Profit is more in goods with big ticket size (large order).
4. Internet business are mostly convience based. 
5. Easy to build digital business in India due to low delivery cost.
6. D2C business mainly rely on their brand. Their product placement is digital. To make d2c a *business*, customer has to purchase your goods offline. Online retail is only for brand building.
7. Fintech business is built on trust.
8. Fundamentals budding entrepreneurs should focus on- pick a market size that is big, how your product is different, eventually your idea should generate profits from customers
9. Ashneer invests in business that form a natural monopoly like fast tag for parking or where there is low cost of delivery and founder should  be dumdaar.
10. People who think about next decade actually make good business. EVs will be one of the biggest segment."
923,when i see Ashneer -- Money just multiples your actual personality(there is very thin line between being Blunt and abusing)
924,Thankyou for this
925,Legendary conversation!
926,Respect 
927,Entrepreneur's becoming celebrities now this is best thing which is happening after a long time  
928,Most of the Indian people didn't like Ashneer grover because of his behaviour against enternpenuar but he is straight forward person and had given best suggestion to new startup owners.
929,Best podcast I have ever seen.
930,For long time I though only those people succed who use English more but you are an example as its inner strenth matters the most. I love Hindi and It was a great show.
931,"Not into podcasts, but this has to be the top one I have ever listened to"

955,"2 se 8 min tak jo cool factor wala baat tha , that should reach to all children who inspire ashneer or who wants good life . Drinking or not drinking It shouldn’t make ur life , without drinking u can be cool enough ."

957,Legendary!
958,"By this time if BharathPe ka IPO hotha, brand value 2X hotha "
959,This is first podcast I have watched whole..
960,9:04 This expression change of ashneer can kill people 
961,Excellent podcast 
962,I have not seen your complete video but I would like to say hear and want to pass on the message to Ashneer that I listen to his audio conversation with Kotak personnel and it is normal according to Delhi standard. Secondly why nowhere is questioning the failure and inefficiency of Kotak Bank? The co-founder and CEO of Bharat Pe have taken advantage of the current situation which is wrong on their part. If they want to get rid off of Ashneer they could have done it ethically rather than resort to the wrong way.
963,Great podcast.
964,We love u ashneer  u r 
965,It's a delight to listen to Ashneer. Thanks Raj for bringing him up and giving your followers lots of straightforward advices.

977,very nice conversation 
978,sometime i feel ashneer is trying to clean up his imagine by going on some influencer platform As he had got a lot of criticism because i didn’t like him a lot on shar tank .
979,Gold ️
980,Ashneer sir jesa koi harich hi nhi hai 
981,1:07:27 Best part I learnt is 'Learn to Say No'

When sir say, are ye tera business bakwas hai. Band kar aur mafi mang le garbalo se. Tab main soucta ta ki koi banda 10 saal spend kordiya is business ko banane ke liye. Kaise chur sakta hai. Today I have understand. 

One of the biggest task is to say No. Market language is Hindi. Be tuff yourself, mundi mat hilao..."
987,Ashneer is the answer to toxic positivity.
988,"He trolled him , in his own show.
I dont listen to any podcast, I havent read a single book.

989,"Ashneer is raw 
raw like a diamond"

1000,This video is Ashneer for child to old... So much of learning
1001,"Yar bohat achi podcast thi. Bohat kuch seekha maine aur dobara bhi dekhun shayad.

Respect from Pakistan ️"
1002,"Hey bro, I really appreciate and enjoy your work and efforts. But at beginning of your intro, you seem to hook an audience in the wrong way. You had shown a glimpse of conversation (which is not true - it's a kind of manipulated and trimmed version. You had also mentioned it in the middle of the conversation). I think you are not able to target your actual audience because of the beginning of your intro. For instance, I would not have seen it completely if I would not have know Ashneer. I think people consume this kind of content to be positive and have positive insights, so listing to a slightly negative version(purposely created) does not hook your actual audience. I am aware that you just did it for kind of clickbait but it restricts you to reach the actual audience. This is what I think and I may be wrong."
1003,Million Dollar Podcast So Jitna Ho Ske. Life Me Implement Krna 
1004,Ashneer Should Write A book So much Practical knowlege

1158,I am very honest to this ashneer

Very bad interviewer seriously....

1211,I am also like Ashneer bas difference itna hai k mere account me 1500 rupay hai. 
1212,I think I can relate to Ashneer a lot. Mere se sugar coating hoti hi nahi.
1213,"a good entrepreneur solves a problem,  a good Indian creates a problem."
1214,What's co-foudner ??
1215,Can you please make a video on profitable unicorn  in India..
1216,"I found some value in ashneer words. But Honest review. "" You must ask sgood questions. I feel you try to ask questions fro starters. What it won't work for someone starting. I wish you ask more about How that person think when they were in their 20's. """
1217,Mene suna hoo ki ashneer sir per episode 8lakh ₹ lete hai
1218,"He didn't started BharatPe but Shashvat Nakrani did and Ashneer joined as investor later became Co-founder of the company eventually was thrown out of the company was the board when the real stance of Ashneer came to the end of investigation.
As they say (The higher you fly, the harder you fall)."

1222,"Business ki language English hai 
Dhandhe ki language hindi hai 
 
                                      -Ashneer grover"
1223,Great Podcast 
1224,I think india is making a better youth by  these type of enterprenour instead of tiktokers
1225,Bharat pe is not started only by Ashneer there is a IIT guy how made this payment gateway Ashneer only helps it to grow up and scale. Give proper information please
1226,"When he said , podcast ka button bhi nahi malum, look at raj's face"
1227,"@Raj Shamani, 55:40 even if they sugar-coated and you ""wasted"" 6 months, I am sure you learned a few things during those 6 months. Least is let's say, whom not to get feedback from. If you believed in that idea at that time and were willing to put some efforts and time in it, I'd say please don't consider it as wasted time -- regardless of what people had or will have to say. Cheers and all the best!"
1228,kunal shah should be on shark tank
1229,आज का ज्ञान :  घूम फिरके सब बनियागिरी है 
1230,best podcast
1231,Vijay is my name and now i am feeling proud bcoz ashneer looked up to a person whose name is vijay
1232,First time im watching YouTube interview without skip for 1:30 hours.
1233,!!!!huge respect. Can see how real he is.
1234,"When he said "" hindustan me koi bhi businesses chlao turnt FIR ho jati h """
1235,I think Raj isn't at that level yet to conduct a podcast with him. We could see him talk nonsense in the middle which is totally unnecessary.
1236,"best best interview. Itna clearly koi businessman nahi btaata, sab secret rakhte hai."
1237,realistic words..
1238,I think host can explode more from Ashneer.
1239,Super podcast
1240,Thnks for the video...leaned some lessons...accha btw who edits your video ?
1241,"Hey Raj 
The best thing you don't do that HMM HMMM HMMM sound like sodabiceps..."
1242,Nice podcast
1243,Ashneer is smart. He gave answer from his t shirt.
1244,"Mai ashneer sir ka boht bada fan hu 
Kabhi kabhi mujhe bhi aisa feel hota hai ki mera attitude ashneer jaisa ho gaya hai  love you sir"
1245,"How 12% club is making money? When it disburse the loan at 12% and at same time paying out interest at 12%.
Can Ashneer himself use his own platform to lend money at 12% to the merchants? I saw a lot of time he offers debt to entrepreneurs at 12% interest in shark tank?"
1246,"This is the big lie, people forget everything next day what they do or say after  drink."
1247,Gussa toh nhi hue ashneer 
1248,"Ashneer has an amazing clarity of what he does. But i would be scared to face him if at all i would be asked to !! national TV pe bejjati hojayegi yaar. However i feel we should reject softly, so that it should not hurt other person because not every one is same, when some one is setting up a business by putting all of his money and he has a huge passion attached to it, If any shark directly comes and say ye to bakwass hai, i think he will break into pieces."
1249,Is it just me who found that ‘Lady with a Car in a Palace’ painting in the background very fascinating and interesting?
1250,Ashneer tu mast banda hai yaar 
1251,Though i am not from India but still i watch these podcasts.
1252,He is my favourite
1253,Naah dude...the death stare Ashneer gave after that 9:04 smile...disturbed me 
1254,Educated person seldomly highlight the diversity of our language.
1255,"Usually I don't like to praise one by pulling other down, but I feel and mind it this is my first watch of this channel, the host was very good with the depth and comfort it brought to talk with the guest.on the other hand, Beer Biceps posdcasts seem quite superficial and the anchor trying to be some knowledge imparting baba. 
Also, I really liked the clarity and straightforwardness of Mr Grover, a true shark."
1256,Best episode
1257,Ashneer jaise honest aur straight forward bande should lead India and inspire..Abhi tak sirf drama/sugar coat karne waale logo ko hi Bhav milta tha and Ashneer jaise logo ko sideline karthe the kyunki wo unko drama aathi nahi
1258,21:19 timestamp for me
1259,Still he duped investors and he n his wife borderline stole money from Bharat pe...board chutiya ni hai ....vo nuksaan uhhane wale ni hai.️satya vachan
1260,The very first podcast that i have listened till the end
1261,"Ashneer, Piuysh,Anupam and Aman in this number are intelligent.Rest ladies were for glamour."
1262,Best 
1263,Very nice podcast
1264,Ashneer you are really cool .
1265,Kala naukar
1266,He is talking about honesty and integrity. Hypocrisy is that he has allegedly misappropriated funds in his own company.
1267,"57:50

That's the man"
1268,
1269,Ashneer should be brand ambassador of Sprite
1270,Most genuine shark
1271,Spelling theek karlo bhai founder*
1272,Ashneer need a lavelplaying interviewer. The interview seems to be one sided intellactual story telling.
1273,"I still can't believe that 
Anupam is 50 years old and 
Ashneer is 39 years old"
1274,Learning and interesting.. Talk
1275,My fav podcaster is chetan bhagat then Ranveer. They make stories more forefront of their conversation but you found little different but I don't know how
1276,Ashneer being Ashneer 19:43
1277,Ajj thera dhobla pan nikalta ku
1278,Very good conversation...ashneer.... Whatever u spoke meant sense ...
1279,Delhiwale jaroori hain sharktank ke lie. It's nothing without Ashneer and Aman. 
1280,Love from nepal ️
1281,Pity on startups who dint pick ashneer over others by having prefixed judgment on him... This man's mind is very sorted with respect to business.
1282,"@RajShamani- you must appoint some thinker to ask relevant questions before you go and meet guys like Ashneer. Padai karna padega Babu 

BharatPe is into giving loan? NBFC ? So they are giving loans to those who can’t get loan from bank - is this correct? What’s BharatPe’s equity book value ? What will it be 4-5 years from now ? Does Ashneer think he will be able to continue giving loans to anyone with QR code and with every year loss in his equity book ? Who will extend loan to BharatPe? Loan book becoming bigger every year but equity book of BharatPe is shrinking  these kind of business don’t exist on earth 

Visit this comment after 4 years and reply me if I’m wrong"
1283,Dogla
1284,"Soon our India will cross   🇨🇳 🇺🇸 
All youth  ...

Jai shree ram"
1285,Ashneer is like an royal guy...
1286,Ashneer bada saaf aadmi hai bhai. Mazza aa gya guru ji
1287,"Raj shamani- be clear not clever 
Ashneer - I am CEO of this"
1288,Bhai..kiya banda hai!!
1289,"He is true Indian businessman
If you also relate me like here "
1290,"My two cousins Tejas and Shreyas  are 10 years old. They picth either day to our joint family to buy equity in thier company ( just 1 Crore for  1% of thier company ). Then when family member asks them meaning of equity, share or debt; they secretly call me to understand and answer back. It's the most revolutionary show, launched at very right time in India. Can't wait to pitch about my startup next season"
1291,"IC engines will not go anywhere, alternative fuels will come and also green hydrogen. Electric is not future"
1292,That's Sick Convo
1293,Duniya kuch bhi kahe par ashneer banda changa hai...
1294,Raghav made it ️️️
1295,"A very well-hosted interview. 

Ashneer is indeed very wise!"
1296,19:42 true words jyada refined tarike se nahi sochta
1297,Ashneer sir is cute 
1298,Next season big boss k liye he is finalized
1299,
1300,"Can someone please explain 27:00 onwards what he is trying to say????????
How is he earning 48% on giving out loans to the merchants when he just said give or take it is 12%"
1301,bhai knowledge to hai...Love you Ashneer bhai.. See you soon
1302,Love from Indore.. ️
1303,0:42 thats the sound of the lift jisme Raghav aaya tha
1304,THE MOST UNCONVENTIONAL INTERVIEW!!!
1305,"I think Ashneer said the wrong thing about stocking of essential items because in abroad Walmart, Target etc are far away from there houses around 6 to 8 km but in India in every society you will find one convenience store which will be around 100m away from the house so Indian think that why to stock just walk 100m and grab your necessary item ""WITHOUT PAYING EXTRA MONEY IN ONLINE PURCHASE""."
1306,"Copy of RAM GOPAL VERMA found… (Straight forward, logical, not getting carried away with emotions )"
1307,Great One
1308,Bhai businessman hai to ye banda baki sab ki to kismat hai matlab no bakwas purely buisness jahan emotions ki zarurat hai wahan logically solution Hina apna loss kiye....... Mza aa gya
1309,"Maza aa gaya, ashneer hero hi hai tu "
1310,Fastest 90 Min of my life. No Cap.
1311,"If that recording had not been viral, the sheer manipulativeness and obnoxiousness of this man would have never come to the Europe."
1312,The beautiful thing is he is absolutely truthful. He doesn't give in on any chance where he feels its irrelevant... like he says there is no advice... and that its not an act... its real..
1313,Too good.
1314,"Yaar mujhe toh Ashneer sir se milna hai abbb ,  koi aur celebrity crush nahi ,  inse baat krke sara concept clear ho sakta hai. i 'll work harder to pay for his time."
1315,I like Doglapan Of Ashneer.... 
1316,I guess there's a reason why Indians don't stock groceries much. I feel there are two mains reasons: Hot climate and Lack of space. Having said that historically most Indians have been stocking food grains rather than buying packaged atta for example. Regardless of that doing a grocery delivery business in India is extremely difficult
1317,"Best ever podcast
Love from Iitkgp"
1318,Why every entrepreneur wants to come from typical middle class family.
1319,"Shark Tank became popular only because of ashneer, aman & peyush. Others are replaceable."
1320,Raj you also did your role best with Mr  Ashneer
1321,"#beingstate ईमानदार आदमी, बिना चीनी के लेप के सच कहा। सत्य अमर है, त्रुटि नश्वर है। मैं वास्तव में उन लोगों को पसंद करता हूं जो हमेशा सच कहते हैं चाहे वह कहीं भी हो।"
1322,He must really hate Namita. So many veiled remarks at her throughout the video lmao
1323,"wow ,what""s a conversation"
1324,Shark tank is unique becoz of Asheer.
1325,A great conversation!!
1326,Maja aa gaya. Just like ki ashneer apne saath baitha hai
1327,Bhot sahi banda h 
1328,"The main question remained unanswered 
Is Ashnerr is extrovert or introvert ?.."
1329,Everything is Subjective ....
1330,"Such a great guy Ashneer. No nonsense guy.
The 'anchor' is so dumb but wants to sound smart. At one point he said 'framework' and didn't make any sense in the statement. He's bragging about speeches at the UN. Such a gimmicky guy."
1331,"Why does Raj have every question or his anecdote also in A, B, C, counting"
1332,Best show
1333,"Might not sub-consciously want to copy American Shark Tank, however, the producers have identified a Leary kinda personality in him and Namita gives a lot of Barbara vibes! Ashneer is a very interesting personality though, thanks for this! Enjoyed the conversation."
1334,Please correct the word ''Indian'' from the description written before IIM Ahmedabad because IIM itself signifies its prestigious name which is -- ''INDIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT'''.
1335,Ashneers father is CA and mother is teacher  in Delhi  and he said that he comes from middle class family  how this is possible?
1336,No one is like Ashneer
1337,"The problem is not about saying No , it is to do with how he said NO in the show. But we dont know if it was the editing that made it look like he is arrogant and rude."
1338,But there is always a reality that ashneer won't reveal all his tricks and secrets
1339,"Ashneer after each such interview ""mere life ke 3 ghante jala diye"""
1340,He is a very logical person. Such a friend to get would be truth at face and you wouldn't fall in sweet words.
1341,You have to solve the problem u cant be the problem........is most imp for me
1342,हिंदी के पास अंग्रेजी से करोड़ों  गुना अधिक शब्द है 🇮🇳🇮🇳
1343,️
1344,"Love and respect for your plain honesty. There is a small ratio of people like Ashneer Grover in India.
It will take us some time to understand the importance of such type of great Founders."
1345,Raj looks like he is fanboying over Ashneer's words
1346,Gautam Gambhir of entrepreneurs
1347,Nice episode
1348,Anyday this podcast is better than any bollywood movie.
1349,"He has good business sense but no humility, isliye khud ki company ne usse nikal rakha hai. He needs to learn humility from Ratan Tata who is also a very good businessman. His life can be put out as a case study for future leaders on what to do and what not to do as a business leader."
1350,Raj bhai trying hard to speak Hindi 
1351,Make ashneer Finance minister of country. This guy has deep understanding of market.
1352,"If only Raj stops is over exaggerated adjectives such as ""Love it"" etc"
1353,"Ashneer is literally like Berlin in Money Heist , initially u don't like him but the more u watch him the more you like him ."
1354,Habbit forming stock religions IPO must be there
1355,57:17 sahi hai sir
1356,This man is a fraud now  always remember all follow the right path. Business is nothing more to earn survival and betterment of consumer life.
1357,My like went to the video at 59:33
1358,Really unfortunate that he's a scammer.
1359,Can you make a video on why entrepreneur got arrested in India 1:08:52.
1360,"how can this logical no nonsense person become a fraudster, difficult to decipher people, i think in india we should stop hyping every person beyond a point, the hero worshiping culture should go, i remember the same happened to the oyo founder ritesh and also to the housing founder rahul yadav"
1361,
1362,M yahan ashneer sir ko search krke aaya hoon ki mjhe esa kuch sunna h. I m big of him and his honesty and clearity
1363,57:28 Ashneer roasted Namita's doglapan here 
1364,If the interviewer was less stoned he could ask more interesting questions.
1365,"1:15:48 i could hear paritosh laugh.
lmao"
1366,Please add English subtitles 
1367,Ashneer sir is so clear
1368,18:20 Dard nikal hi gaya NAYKA k liye
1369,Ashneer

1371,Fucking legend
1372,"Business ki language English hai

1373,Awesome
1374,"If you can't be the problem, you have to solve the problem"
1375,"Yeah sure, i agree he is good businessman but a bad example and entrepreneur. Just check out the recent video on deshbhakt channel"
1376,Jab aaj k bache fav actor ki jgah fav businessman bolay...fav movie ki jgah fav business story bolay...tb india kai ameer hone kai steps shuru ho jyga
1377,broo subtitles add please.
1378,The interviewer should not just keep repeating what Ashneer said. Instead have an interesting take or go to next question.
1379,Because of ashneer I'm watching
1380,Its better not to follow anyone. Do what you feel. MRP is the best thing. India is the best. Money is not indicator of stature or happiness.
1381,Bohot shi ek dam correct!!
1382,Shark tank made entrepreneurs to celebrities overnight
1383,Mu favourite entrepreneur
